# ProfileWiz
A tool to support round-tripping between modular and flattened versions of profiles of data models expressed using OWL, JSON-Schema, SHACL etc.

ProfileWiz uses the [W3C Profiles Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/) to both accept configuration and output documentation of locations of various different views of data model profiles used and generated by different operating modes.

## Status
In development, focussed on Use Case 1.


## Use Cases
1. **Flattened => Modular**  
Take a data model (such as an OWL ontology) containing copied (and potentially modified) versions of definitions from "standard" models, intended to document a profile of those external models, and build a better Modular version that contains clear expression of the intended constraints on the original model, and create implementation resources such as JSON-LD contexts with imports of reusable, cachable modules.
2. **Modular Model => Flattened**  
Take a modular profile hierarchy and create "flattened" versions with no requirement for imports
3. **Profile validity**  
Consistency checking of profiles with respect to their base specifications - do they break any of the specs' rules?
4. **Implementation => Models**  
Extract data models from implementation resources - such as JSON-schema and JSON-LD context documents


## Installation
Clone this repository.

run python profilewiz --help

or to install as a editable module

pip install -e <workingcopy>

TODO: replace with package install once stable


## Usage
usage:  
```
~$ profilewiz.py [-h] [-o [OUTPUT]] [-q] [-r] [-p P [P ...]] input
```

Create JSON context, schema and other views of an ontology

positional arguments:
```bash
  input                 input file containing ontology in TTL format
```

optional arguments:
```bash
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o [OUTPUT], --output [OUTPUT]
                        output file
  -q, --qnames_only     use qnames only for JSON elements
  -r, --force_relative  use relative filenames and cached copies for imports
  -p P [P ...], --profiles P [P ...]
                        file name or URL of profiles model with pre-configured
                        resource locations
```
